# SparkMeter API integration

This plugin uses **KoiosAPI** for the main authentication. 
After it got authenticated it uses the **ThunderCloud API** for basic CRUD operations.

You need to enter the **ThunderCloud Token** on the site levels. 

Koios access gives us the ability to synchronize the elder transactions( or the transaction that are not processed over Micropowermanager).


### Installation
`composer require inensus/spark-meter`
